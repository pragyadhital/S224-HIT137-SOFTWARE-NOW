thiamine folate and a multivitamin his afib with rvr was initially treated with metoprolol then diltiazem his high ammonia levels were treated with lactulose his b l ankle fractures were followed by orthopedics the patient was severely agitated on more than one occassion during this hospitalization requiring three codes puples to be called as well as requiring restraints for protection of both the patient and the staff the patient was originally sent from the floor to the micu with delirium of unknown cause and severe agititation he required increased amounts of sedation and was returned to the floor after a ng tube was placed once returned to the floor the patient required less sedation was taken off of any benzodiazipines and only intermittently needed restraints the patient remained somnolent and delerious he pulled out his ng tube he was also febrile and rhoncorous on the floor he was initially treated with vancomycin and flagyl which was changed to azithro ceftriaxone flagyl he

patient was started on zosyn and restarted on vancomycin wiht marked improvement in his respiratory status within a few days of returning to the floor vancomycin and zosyn were stopped as cxr showed resolution of questionable aspiration pneumonia this was felt to be more likely pneuomonitis which resolved after the micu patients delirium started to improve but then worsened when he returned to the or for removal of external fixation he developed fevers to f post operatively which likely worsened delirium source of fevers unclear of note patient had recently developed vre in his urine but infectious disease did not feel this was an active infection he received three days of antibiotics daptomycin and then linezolid when these were stopped he became afebrile and delirium began to lift aggitation was mostly controlled with haldol zyprexa was tried for two weeks but it did not seem to help acute aggitation qtc was monitored while patient was on antipsychotics and was stable at approximately msec overall etiology of delirium has remained unclear but was thought to be multifactorial due in part to chronic alcohol use hepatic encephalopathy benzodiazepine use and post operative delririum although spanish speaking sitters and interpreters were employed as much as possible language also likely contributed to persistance of delirium delirium has completely resolved patient is now restraint and sitter free all haldol has been stopped he has past the period of etoh withdrawal it is recommended that patient follow up with alcohol abuse counseling afib flutter while febrile his afib flutter was complicated by more frequent episodes of rapid ventricular rate this was controlled with iv metoprolol when needed but also by increasing po metoprolol and diltiazem treating fever with tylenol also seemed to help he was briefly put on therapeutic lovenox for atrial fibrillation but this was stopped as he was not felt to be eligible by chads criteria and also because of high fall risk patient was transitioned off of beta blockers and placed on diltiazem mg daily urinary retention patient failed several voiding trials he also pulled out his foley on several occasions causing hematuria intermittent straight catheterization was tried to reduce infection risk of long term indwelling foley however given delirium and aggitation this was untenable this

seizure and mental status changes and was found to have seizure meningitis the patient presented with a seizure a fever to and altered mental status he was unable to answer questions about localizing symptoms meningitis was initially suspected due to skin rash though this was more maculopapular than petechial in nature on the first day of his hospitalization he received vancomycin ceftriaxone and acyclovir which would be appropriate empiric treatment of a non specified meningitis encephalitis unfortunately due to difficulties with obtaining an lp this was not performed until hospital day three and showed pleiocytosis and increased protein but was ultimately culture negative ultimately this was thought most consistent with partially treated bacterial meningitis therefore the patient was treated with vancomycin ceftriaxone with resolution of his fevers and improvement of his mental status to baseline without further seizures acyclovir was stopped when hsv pcr returned negative the patient will ultimately need to complete fourteen days of antibiotic therapy for meningitis seizure the patient has a previous history of seizures and has been on phenytoin his previous seizures have not been grand mal but this appears to have been the type that occurred on the day of presentation the likely precipitant of this seizure was the patients infection and fever though phenytoin level was also a bit low initially he was maintained on iv phenytoin then fospheynytoin but then transitioned back to his outpatient po regimen as mental status resolved he never showed signs of further seizure activity and eeg obtained to rule out further seizure activity was not consistent with persistent epileptiform activity allergic reaction respiratory failure the patient had a presentation of rash hypotension and per report swelling of the throat and tongue this could be consistent with acute allergic reaction and the tmp sulfa he had been given for cellulitis is certainly a potential causative doctor last name still it seems unlikely he would react suddenly and this remarkably to tmp sulfa after he had been receiving it for a full day nevertheless he was treated appropriately for an anaphylactic reaction with epinephrine histamine blocker and steroids and recovered respiratory failure as stated before it is difficult to tell if the patient actually had anaphylactic shock leading to airway compromise and respiratory failure other possible etiologies would include pulmonary edema given need for vigorous fluid resuscitation soon after presentation and oversedation in the emergency departments ultimately the patient was weaned off supplementary oxygen without event altered mental status per the patients mother at baseline he has the mental status of a small child with minimal verbal communication skills but he follows commands and interacts appropriately the patient was initially extremely somonolent and then minimally responsive raising concern for non convulsive status epilepticus eeg was more consistent with encephalopathy however and the patients mental status eventually resolved to baseline with treatment of his underlying condition and maximization of other variables likely this was due to toxic metabolic delirium in the context of severe infection history of dvt the patient has a history of two dvts and thus is presumably on lifelong anticoagulation his inr was initially supratherapeutic so further anticoagulation was held then he was transitioned to low molecular weight heparin for systemic anticoagulation while he was npo once he was eating warfarin was restarted and lmwh was stopped after hours of therapeutic inr on coumadin non sustained ventricular tachycardia on the morning of the patient had two brief runs of nsvt that broke without further management this was discussed with ep who thought barring signs of structural heart disease that this likely had no prognostic significance and was likely simply a response to acute illness the patient had an echocardiogram that was within normal limits and he had no further episodes of vt of note this also happened while he was being phenytoin loaded which may have contributed to arrythmia fen the patient initially required tube feeds due to altered mental status and lack of inclination to eat he self discontinued his dobhoff unfortunately and due to a desire to spare another invasive process if possible he was observed and thankfully had cleared enough to tolerate po in around forty eight hours after that he tolerated a full diet with out incident he

hospital course by problem list is as follows septic shock purpura fulminans blood culture bottles at hospital hospital were positive for n meningitidis although near daily cultures of blood sputum and urine throughout the patients icu stay remained negative on admission to the icu the patient recieved a day course of xigris and a day course of empiric stress dose steroids hydrocortisone fludricortisone to treat his infection he had an d course of cephalosporin for meningococcemia recieved ceftriaxone x d then cefepime vancomycin and flagyl he persistently spiked nightly fevers to and he had a profound leukocytosis up to k with l shift culture data remained negative and his only source was a questionable lll pneumonia on cxr bedside flexible bronchoscopy and a bal were pristine so antibiotics were discontinued on hospital day he briefly defervesced after changing of his central venous catheter but then continued to have nightly fevers he recieved another d course of vancomycin cefepime and flagyl empirically when these antibiotics were discontinued his white count had normalized although he continued to have low grade fevers infectious disease was consulted upon admission and followed the patient throughout his hospital stay the patient also was noted to have progressive acral necrosis of his fingers and toes this was followed daily by the icu team and plastic hand surgery and podiatry were consulted there was no evidence of wet gangrene progressive infection and the necrosis was allowed to demarcate by discharge from the icu this had been stable for one week and the patients necrosis remained limited to the distal phalanxes of bilateral hands largely sparing the thumbs as well as the distal phalanx of bilateral feet occupational therapy was consulted to help the patient with this and the patient will be followed as an outpatient or at rehab by ot he also will follow up weekly with hand surgery and podiatry to assess need for amputation versus allowing auto amputation the patient also had diffuse lower extremity bullae and purpura which were cared for supportively with hospital bacitracin as well as xeroform dressings persistent fevers intravenous access was difficult to obtain and access was maintain via l subclavian central venous catheter this was removed in the setting of persistent fevers and ir placed a picc line blood cultures revealed methicillin resistant staph epidermidis and pt was started on vancomycin for day course c diff toxin assay were also positive and the patient was started on metronidazole pt was sent to or for surgical wound debridement with podiatry of the r foot wound cultures revealed pseudomonas and ceftazidime was started for full gram negative coverage acute renal failure upon admission the patient was noted to have a cr bun from presumed normal baseline this trended up to a maximum cr of on hd the renal team was following the patient throughout his stay and thought the renal failure was likely acute tubular necrosis from his sepsis dialysis was considered but the patient never met acute indications for dialysis he was treated prn with high dose diuretics lasix mg iv and diuril mg iv up to hospital for decreased urine output in the context of anasarca however predominately he was treated supportively and from hd his creatine began to trend down and he autodiuresed significantly by discharge from the icu his creatinine had normalized to respiratory failure the patient was intubated on arrival due to respiratory distress fatigue with profound metabolic acidosis initial chest xrays were consisted with ards and the patient was maintained on lung protective ventilation as mentioned above daily chest xrays showed questionable pneumonia versus pulmonary edema the patient was on vancomycin cefepime and flagyl and was also diuresed his chest xrays continued to show significant edema however his vent settings were able to be weaned over his stay he was not able to pass a spontaneous breathing trial and extubation was also deferred because the patient had significant oral lesions and glossal edema raising the concern for difficulty in reintubation the patient therefore recieved a tracheostomy tube and peg tube with thoracic surgery he tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively was quickly able to be transitioned to a trach mask then a passamuir valve over the course of days his respiratory status remained stable throughout the remainder of his icu stay cardiovascular system the patient had several different cardiovascular issues during his stay on hd an echo showed severely depressed lv function with estimated ef repeat echo on hd showed improved but still severly depressed lv function ef this was not repeated during his icu stay he also had one episode of non sustained beats ventricular tachycardia his hemodynamics were stable and his electrolytes were normal at this time however and he had no further episodes of similar tachycardias he was maintained on telemetry throughout this stay he did have elevation of his cardiac biomarkers which peaked on hospital day with a troponin t of his cks had been elevated thought due to his acral necrosis and his ekgs were unchanged the troponinemia was ascribed to his renal failure and systolic heart failure as opposed to an nstemi and indeed the rise and fall improved with resolution of his renal function he should have a repeat echo as an outpatient in weeks after hospital discharge additionally after resolution of his initial sepsis the patient was persistently tachycardic hr usually s s up to s always sinus rhythm and hypertensive sbps up to s s the etiology was thought to be due to a combination of pain anxiety and fevers and a generalized state of sympathetic excess the patient was started on amlodipine hydralizine and metoprolol neurologic as the patients sedation was weaned in advance of possible extubation he was noted to have questionable neurologic deficits specifically he was not moving his upper extremities spontaneously and while he was able to follow commands by eye blinking he did not appear to demonstrate any tracking movements with his eyes as he had been on xigris and also had significant microvascular pathology in other organ systems an mri head cspine was obtained to rule out intracerebral or spinal hematoma bleeds or infection this examination was normal an ophthamologic consult was also obtained to perform a dilated pupil retinal exam this showed diffuse bilateral retinal hemorrhages and outpatient follow up was reccomended his tracking gaze and upper extremity movement continued to improve as sedation was weaned fluids nutrition the patient was maintained on tube feeds throughout his admission initially he had high residuals and therefore was supplemented with parenteral nutrition nutrition service provided useful reccomendations by discharge the patient had passed a speech and swallow examination and was tolerating po intake with his pm valve in place from a fluids standpoint the patient required initial aggressive fluid rescuscitation for his sepsis and insensible volume losses and was significantly volume overloaded throughout his stay although this improved dramatically with forced and auto diuresis and improvement of his renal function transfer to floor the patients renal failure normalized his creatinine returned to normal the patient was breathing room air through a tracheostomy tube the trach tube was removed on soon afterward he was tolerating po food the g tube was removed on the patient spiked low grade temperatures until when his temperature remained below f cultures were positive for the following mrse in blood and wound culture in blood in wound c diff yeast in wound cultures in wound culture pseudomonas in wound cultures in wound culture for these organisms the patient was continued on vancomycin started cefepime to ciprofloxacin started and metronidazole started he will continue to get a full six week course of these antibiotics his foot wounds were dressed daily by podiatry using duoderm gel on dry sterile dressings and xenoform on leg wounds bacitracin on leg bullae his fingers were dressed with dry sterile dressing between the fingers to minimize maceration the patient is discharged to a rehab facility in stable condition for continued physical therapy daily dressing changes and iv antibiotic treatment vancomycin he requires substantial pain control especially for his dressing changes and he has developed a tolerance to morphine his pain is controlled with mg morphine every morning before dressing changes and he has tolerated a sliding scale of morphine mg for physical therapy and any additional dressing changes or examinations of the wounds he is

midline surgical incision with staples remained clean and intact staples can be removed and steri strips placed at the ouitpatient nursing facility on pod endocrine as above endocrinology was consulted given the finding of a suppressed tsh of less than in the context of atrial fibrillation the patient has a history of multinodular goiter futher thyroid studies were evaluated she was started on methimazole tapazole mg po daily an anti thyroid medication for biochemical thyrotoxicosis of note the risks of this medication are rare hepatic failure and agranulocytosis patient should be instructed that if she develops a fever or sore throat she should stop the methimazole immediately and have a cbc checked there is not a need for surveillance cbc or lfts as these reactions are acute a thyroid scan was ruled out given the patient recent high iv contrast burden to avoid renal impact the aptient will follow up with endocrine as an outpatient in weeks at which time repeat

difficulty clearing his own secretions although his sputum production as well as initial leukocytosis improved his wcc normalised on transfer to the medical hospital on a sputum culture returned with gpcs although culture revealed no growth and his ceftriaxone was stopped and levofloxacin was continued initially iv then changed to oral on his initial inr was on admission and he received vitamin k this quickly falling into the normal therapeutic range he was restarted on warfarin on and his inr remained therapeutic due to concern for aspiration risk he was seen by speech and swallow and they recommeded a video swallow which showed an impaired oral stage with trace aspiration on thin liquids they recommended thin fluids and soft solids with meds crushed in puree they acknowledged that he was an aspiration risk with any diet type he continued to receive chest physical therapy while on the hospital and requierd intermittent suctioning for his secretions his wcc remained stable and he

although there is certainly evidence of a moderate r effusion his levofloxacin was continued and whiel he initially requierd regular suctioning as he became less drowy this improved his respiratory

examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in the bed on vicu cognition language speech voice awake alert but slow to respond limited verbal output appearing fatigued he did follow one step commands though inconsistently with a delay and with visual cues modeling pts speech was intelligible and fluent but responses were very limited vocal quality was breathy though the pt could generate adequate voicing with effort teeth edentulous secretions mild amount of thick clear sputum was stranding from the hard palate to the tongue this was removed with the yankauer catheter oral

swallowing assessment was completed at bedside with ice chips thin liquids tsp cup purees tsp x and nectar thick liquid tsp cup oral transit was minimally slowed though no residue was noted pt had a difficult time initiating taking any pos so feeding was required however he would not open his mouth sufficiently to actually allow adequate boluses into his mouth laryngeal elevation appeared adequate to palpation though he swallowed multiple times per bolus he did c o sensation of puree sticking in his throat overt coughing was noted with thin liquids and pt confirmed sensation of aspiration no further pos could be assessed as pt refused any more boluses summary impression pt is demonstrating overt signs of aspiration with thin liquids but more significantly is refusing all pos despite maximal encouragement as such beyond thin liquids the examination was limited by the pts fatigue delayed response time and refusal notes from discharge facility indicate poor po intake has been an issue but the pt was on a full po diet so it appears that he was able to advance off of tube feedings unclear whether this decline is related to post op somnolence or possible toxic metabolic issues noted per neurology however at this time i would recommend the pt remain npo with enteral nutrition and medications via the peg we will plan to re evaluate pt later this week either or recommendations remain npo with enteral nutrition and medications via the peg mr head w o contrast pm interpretation there are several areas of hyperintensity on the diffusion weighted images these are located in the right frontal and left occipital lobes with questionable involvement of the left frontal lobe these areas are hyperintense on flair raising the possibility that they may represent t shine through however these diffusion findings are new since the prior mr examination therefore these likely reflect relatively new ischemia although they may not be truly acute there is no evidence of hemorrhage edema masses or mass effect the vessels appear unchanged with a large right a and no detectable left a branch of the anterior cerebral artery impression several areas of diffusion abnormality suggesting recent infarction no evidence of hemorrhage ct head w o contrast pm findings there is no evidence of hemorrhage mass effect or shift of normally midline structures chronic right frontal and parietal lobe infarctions are again noted marked periventricular white matter hypodensity is again seen most consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions the ventricles are prominent and similar in size and symmetry the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated impression no evidence of hemorrhage stable prominent ventricles note added at attending review i agree with the above interpretation however i am concerned that the cta may suggest an arteriovenous malformation there were numerous prominent vessels arterial and venous and no explanation for the hemorrhage i discussed this concern with dr last name stitle at pm on ekg atrial fibrillation mean ventricular rate compared to the previous tracing of no major change intervals axes rate pr qrs qt

epidural placed for pain control l renal cross clamp time minutes argatroban was administered intra operatively prolong intubation in sicu requiring pressure support metabolic acidosis on there was a period of hypotension to s s requiring pressor support but this was transient pt was extubated on pain is currently being managed with dilaudid pca and bupivacaine epidural the last morphine dose was at pm on epidural dc by pain service pt has been somewhat difficult to arouse with limited speech output and eye rolling during morning rounds prompting consult for seizure evaluation from neurology

dilaudid being used for pain control pt received fundaperinox from transition to coumadin for afib hx of hit pos when inr at goal fundaperinox was dcd pt with difficulty swallowing g tube pt on tf speech and swallow consult obtained bedside swallowing evaluation history thank you for referring this year old male admitted from hospital on for aaa repair aaa was diagnosed when pt was admitted s p right parietal subacute infarction as well as right intraventricular hemorrhage post op neurology was consulted as the pt was somnolent with decreased speech output neurology consult reported that the pt may have toxic metabolic encephalopathy related to post surgical state and sedative medications being used for pain control pmh includes s p right parietal subacute infarction and right intraventricular hemorrhage seizure disorder abdominal aortic aneurysm atrial fibrillation hypertension copd chf pulmonary hypertension benign prostatic hypertrophy t compression fracture found s p mrsa bacteremia s p heparin induced thrombocytopenia s p cholecystectomy uti we were consulted this admission to evaluate whether pt was able to swallow safely we evaluated the pt multiple times last admission with the last examination being a video swallow study completed on that study revealed a mild moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia that worsened over time after fatigue he demonstrated reduced a p tongue movement moderate oral cavity residue moderately reduced hyolaryngeal excursion and laryngeal valve closure moderate vallecular residue and mild pyriform sinus residue pt was observed to penetrate both thin and nectar thick liquids with eventual aspiration of residue of thin liquids because pts oral and pharyngeal muscles fatigued so quickly he was at risk to aspirate any texture of solid or liquid over the course of an entire meal as such we recommended that the pt remain primarily npo at this time with nutrition hydration and medication via peg per discharge summary from rehab facility the pt participated in speech therapy had a repeat video swallow study and progressed to a ground solid thin liquid po diet while at rehab however his po intake remained poor despite stopping tube feedings and starting the pt on megace however notes from rehab facility and extended care facility indicate the pt was solely on a po diet not on tube feedings prior to admission here for aaa
