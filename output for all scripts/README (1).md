## Assignment Breakdown

### Question 1: Natural Language Processing with Python
This segment of the assignment is dedicated to the application of NLP techniques using powerful libraries such as SpaCy, scispaCy, and Transformers.

#### Task 1: Aggregating Text Data
- Objective: Consolidate the text content from multiple CSV files into a single `.txt` file for subsequent analysis.

#### Task 2: Library Setup
- Tools Installed:
  - **SpaCy**: Deployed with specialized models `en_core_sci_sm` and `en_ner_bc5cdr_md` for biomedical text processing.
  - **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: Integrated with BioBERT, a model adept at recognizing entities such as drugs and diseases.

#### Task 3: Word Frequency Analysis and Tokenization
- **Task 3.1**: We utilized a Python library to calculate word frequencies in the text file, isolating the top 30 most frequent words and exporting this data into a CSV file.
- **Task 3.2**: Leveraging the `AutoTokenizer` function from the Transformers library, we created a function to identify and rank the top 30 unique tokens from the text.

#### Task 4: Named-Entity Recognition (NER) Comparison
- We performed NER to extract `disease` and `drug` entities using both SpaCy models and BioBERT. The results were compared to analyze the efficacy and differences between these models.

### Question 2: The Quest for Hidden Knowledge
Embark on a code-driven adventure through the mystical land of Pythoria, where programming skills unlock the path to the hidden treasure.

#### Chapter 1: The Gatekeeperâ€™s Challenge
- Task: Modify the pixel values of `Chapter1.png` using an algorithmically generated number and produce a new image (`chapter1out.png`). Sum all red pixel values from the new image to progress to the next chapter.

#### Chapter 2: The Chamber of Strings
- To be explored in subsequent stages of the quest.

### Question 3: Decoding and Debugging
- This task involved decrypting an encrypted code, identifying errors in the original decrypted code, and rectifying them with detailed explanations provided through comments.

### Question 4: Collaborative GitHub Repository
- A public GitHub repository has been created for this project, where all team members actively contributed. This repository not only serves as a codebase but also as a record of our collective efforts.

## Repository Structure
- **`data/`**: CSV files containing the raw text data.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for executing each task.
- **`output/`**: Contains the `.txt` file, CSV output, and processed images.
- **`images/`**: The original and processed images from Chapter 1.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for development and testing.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation and overview.
- **`LICENSE`**: Repository licensing information.

## How to Use
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure all required libraries are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Running Scripts**: Navigate to the `scripts/` directory and execute the scripts in sequential order.
3. **Review Outputs**: All results will be saved in the `output/` directory for easy access.
